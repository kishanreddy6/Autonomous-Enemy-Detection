# Autonomous-Enemy-Detection
This project is part of the course requirements of ROB-GY 6103, Advance Mechatroniics, at NYU which was demonstarated along with my fellow teammates Arun Kumar Srivathsa and Indupuru Sriharsha Reddy.

The task is to design an autonomous robot that can navigate the streets of Manhattan, find enemy intruders, and eliminate them while avoiding obstacles and following traffic rules. The robot must start from one of two safe houses, follow a path marked by black tape, and reach the start position without stopping. The robot must locate friendlies and enemies using a camera mounted on it, identify them using fiducial markers, and provide an indication of reaching each location by stopping in front of them and providing clear indications for friendlies and enemies. The robot must knock off the enemies from their car or podium without hurting the friendlies. The friendlies and enemies will be randomly placed on the map, and the robot will be assigned only locations it can reach without breaking traffic rules. The robot uses two microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and Propeller Activity Board, which have communication established between them.
